                                    Having spent the last century living up to its moniker as a dull politician’s playground filled with boring bureaucrats, Canberra is suddenly experiencing a Capital of Cool moment. Of course, history fanatics will still get their fix of stately government institutions, heritage buildings and eminent museums and galleries that are undeniably the best in the country.

                                It’s all dreamy surf beaches, top-tier entertainment venues, and a dazzling harbour in the superstar of New South Wales. And while it’s a city happy to charge forward with edgy trends and creative developments, there’s enough cultural depth to keep history buffs happy; from the 100-year-old Bondi Icebergs to the Royal Botanic Gardens (thought to be the oldest public gardens in the Southern Hemisphere). And then, of course, there’s the long list of icons; most famously the Sydney Opera House.

                                While not as showy as its flashy northern sister, Sydney, the progressive state capital of Victoria is one of Australia’s coolest metropolitan marvels. There’s gourmet foodie offerings, hipster bars, a thriving arts scene, and a vibe that’s more European than any of its cosmopolitan rivals. As for sport, the Australian Football League Grand Final, Australian Open Tennis Championships, and Formula 1 Grand Prix are all held here.

                                It may be one of the most isolated cities on earth, but that hasn’t stopped Western Australia’s youthful capital from stepping ahead of its competitors. This frontier-town-made-chic tempts with slick wine bars and restaurants, sweeping parkland, achingly cool festivals, excellent markets, glittering beaches, and a skyline to rival Manhattan. Equally thrilling are the rejuvenation projects that are changing the face of the city

                                For all the sun, sea and surf you can muster, Queensland’s iconic coastal city that sits immediately north of the border with New South Wales is all glitz and glamour; think flashy high-rises, seaside markets, and Orlando-style theme parks (Wet ’n’ Wild Water World, Warner Brothers Movie World). This is also where you’ll find gourmet dining, 57 kilometres of pristine sands

                                Once a penal colony for British convicts sent from Sydney, the sunny state capital of Queensland is one of the country’s most up-and-coming cities. Much here is focussed around the Brisbane River - the glittering waterway where you can abseil the Kangaroo Point cliffs, scale the iconic Story Bridge, and rollerblade over floating walkways. But away from the water, it’s obvious that this city is loving its Brisvegas label

                                It’s all stunning vineyards, amazing eco-adventures, outstanding festivals, and a strong urban arts and foodie scene in Adelaide - South Australia’s elegant capital named in honour of Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen, queen consort to King William IV. The vibe is more like a big country town than a buzzing metropolis, with most making a beeline for the gorgeously green hills, the lovely ocean beaches,

                                   <br> Much closer to Asia than its ‘down south’ neighbours, Australia's only tropical capital city appeals with a balmy year-round climate, cultural attractions galore, and a rather smart waterfront precinct that has transformed the look and luxe of the place. There’s also a harbour to trump Sydney’s, two incredible nearby national parks (Kakadu and Litchfield), sunsets so famous that entire events are based around them
